## üåç Project Overview

Traditional historical education often relies on static images, textbooks, or museum visits, which can limit engagement and fail to convey the true scale and cultural richness of ancient civilizations. Additionally, many significant historical landmarks are either in ruins, located in remote areas, or are otherwise inaccessible to the average person.

**HISTORICA** addresses these challenges by providing:

- Interactive, historically accurate **3D reconstructions** of ancient landmarks.
- Web-based **AR and VR** experiences‚Äîno headset or additional hardware required.
- Rich educational content integrated through **clickable annotations** and storytelling.
- A highly **accessible platform** that works on standard desktop and mobile browsers.

## üéØ Objectives

- Enhance the engagement and retention of historical knowledge through immersive media.
- Provide a universally accessible platform for education, tourism, and cultural research.
- Digitally preserve world heritage sites for future generations.
- Reduce financial and geographical barriers to cultural exploration.
